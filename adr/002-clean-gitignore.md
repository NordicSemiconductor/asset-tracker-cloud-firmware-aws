# ADR 002: Clean `.gitignore` file

A `.gitignore` file in a project must only cover the artifacts caused by the
contained source code and not those caused by the personal choice of editor or
the environment of a developer.

This is explained in detail
[here](https://github.com/coderbyheart/first-principles/issues/30).
